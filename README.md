# STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTION-USING-LSTM-AND-CNN
       Tool to accurately predict the future closing value of a given stock across a given period
       of time in the future.
       
## Model Building of LSTM/CNN

       1.Reading data using parse date
       2.Correlation Analysis
       3.Normalizing the data
       4.Train test Split using Timeseriessplit
       5.Benchmark Model
       6.Process the data for LSTM/CNN
       7.Model building : LSTM/CNN
       8.Evaluation of Model/CNN
       9.Predictions made by LSTM/CNN
       10.LSTM's Prediction Visual
       11.Converting Prediction data to a excel file
       
## Output

       The prediction results for LSTM and CNN is saved in
       excel files;
